review
i wish would have gotten one earlier love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier
i ve learned this lesson again open the package and use the product right away ordered this mouse in august as my travel mouse and just packed it away in my bag now ve been visiting family in the pnw since mid september the mouse took charge and worked fine for couple of weeks after recharged the mouse it worked for day or two and then ceased to function the optical light will flash once when turned on then nothing of course the return window is well past 
it is so slow and lags find better option
roller ball stopped working within months of minimal use piece of junk 
i like the color and size but it few days out of the return period and it will not hold charge
overall love this mouse the size weight clicking is all fabulous however ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use it wasn dropped literally was not even touching it the second time and heard it fall if you need to use the middle scroller lot do not recommend purchase if you don use that feature then it great mouse 
it stopped working
my son uses school issued chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse so we looked into wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews unfortunately the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it month since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case he was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at campground there is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable am sure this has been great product for many and we likely got the dud so am not telling anyone not to buy it but am sharing our experience for others to consider 
loved this cute little mouse but it broke after months the wheel broke off from the gear 
should ve spent the money to get quality product this thing stopped working after about week worthless
