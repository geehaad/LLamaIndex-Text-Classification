i wish would have gotten one earlier love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier.
i like the color and size but it few days out of the return period and it will not hold charge.
i ve learned this lesson again open the package and use the product right away ordered this mouse in august as my travel mouse and just packed it away in my bag now ve been visiting family in the pnw since mid september the mouse took charge and worked fine for couple of weeks after recharged the mouse it worked for day or two and then ceased to function the optical light will flash once when turned on then nothing of course the return window is well past 
I like you
